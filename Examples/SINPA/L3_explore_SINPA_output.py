Lecture 3 of the examples to run the SINPA code: Analysis

Jose Rueda Rueda: jrrueda@us.es

Done to explain how to explore and analysise SINPA runs

It is supposed that you have run your SINPA simulation before

Created for version 0.7.3 of the Suite and version 0.1 of SINPA

last revision:
    ScintSuite: version 1.0.4

    # fortran for the SINPA code. If you need to change the used interpolators,
    # you can do it with the followed functions:รง
    # smap._calculate_mapping_interpolators(): it calculate the interpolators,
    # accept several options to change the kernel and degree of the function
    # smap.remap_strike_points(): just apply the interpolator to the strike
    # points and store the information inside the matrix smap.strike_points.data
    # you can remap in the pixel or in the real space it also update the
    # information of the header of he strike points object

    # several options, updates are more than wellcome

    # the user want to plotted in cm like in the old FILDSIM, the next line
    # will do the job):

    # ascendent order, 'x1' and 'x2' are the 2 coorditanes of the strike points
    # on the scintillator
    # overplot the strike map

    # we can use the same method to plot any 2 variables of the strike points
    # for example, we can explore the correlations between the initial
    # gyrophase (called beta in the suite) and the incident angle (called theta
    # in the suite)

    # next version

    # style, explore your beloved one)
