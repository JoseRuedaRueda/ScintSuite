"""
Lecture 3 of the examples to run the SINPA code: Analysis

Jose Rueda Rueda: jrrueda@us.es

Done to explain how to explore and analysise SINPA runs

It is supposed that you have run your SINPA simulation before

Created for version 0.7.3 of the Suite and version 0.1 of SINPA

    # smap.remap_strike_points(): just apply the interpolator to the strike
    # points and store the information inside the matrix

    # the strike points object
