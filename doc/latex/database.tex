\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Lines with comments. In principle the default number is 5, but this number can be changes when we read the database, ie, any number can be valid as far as this number is passed as input when the database object is initialised
\item Database, organised in rows, each row containing all data from one calibration, starting from a calibration ID and followed by all the fields in the order indicated above. See any example for more information
