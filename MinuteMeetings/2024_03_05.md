# Discussion Topics / Actions
- Brief introduction of each FILDSIM/Suite User and what they use the code for. Current new developments:
	- Remap of APD camera (fast channel)-> TCV team
	- Use of energy and normalized pitch angle as remap variables-> TCV team
	- ITER FILD design-> Seville team
	- Algebraic techniques for tomography-> MU and Seville team (based on Bo's work for AUG)
- Requested topic:
	- TCV:
		- Slightly better documentation (seems like the gyroradius definition was not clear). Action: Jose will extend the documentation of the `get_energy` function of the strike map
		- Faster remap method. Action: we have no clue how to make it faster, we will open an issue in GitHub as a request feature for the future
	- Seville:
		- GUI to perform the whole analysis so the *vanilla* user does not need to deal with the API. Action: We will open an issue in GitHub such that the users can request features for the GUI. Alex will lead this development
	- MU:
		- Consistency, backward compatibility and support. They need to code to be stable and not have to change all parameter in each release. Action: none, after 1.0.0 release things are kinda good in that sense with no retro-compatibility issues, so the only action is to keep the nice work :)
