## Remap methods
---
### Centers
- All signal from each pixel is concentrated in a single marker in velocity space
$$ S_{ij}(E,R) = C_{ij}\delta(E - \psi_E(x_1, x_2), R -\psi_R(x_1, x_2))  $$

- Fast but inaccurate if the pixel is large compare to the map
---
### Monte Carlo
- Signal is divided in multiple markers:
$$ S_{ij}(E,R) = \frac{C_{ij}}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\delta(E - \psi_E(x_1^k, x_2^k), R -\psi_R(x_1^k, x_2^k))  $$
- Information is accumulated in a matrix T
	$$ S_{\alpha\beta} = T_{\alpha\beta}^{ij} S_{ij}$$
- ~ 1 Minute per frame. Large (> 50 Gb) matrix created if the grid is dense
- Same matrix can be used for different frames

---
### In-place Monte Carlo
- Similar to Monte Carlo, but remap is accumulated in the remap frame for each marker
	- No need of T matrix
	- Need to recalculate the same MC for each frame
- Free memory (run in any laptop) at expenses of speed
- Available for next release!!!
---
### In-place fast Monte Carlo
- Improved in-place Monte Carlo based on Numba library
- Challenge of interpolation, but we could be in the ~ second time scale
- Future plan
---
## Tomography
---
### New regression algorithms
- Algebraic reconstructions
---
### New coupling with iHIBPsim code
- Track fast ions and calculate their constant 
- of motion
- Mapping to orbit space
---
### Weight function coordinates
$$W(E_r, \lambda_r, E, \lambda) \to W(x,y, E, \lambda)$$

# Discussions
## Weight function coordinates
- Advantages of the WF in pixel space:
	- Directly related with the measurement (camera frame)
	- Conceptually easier to understand than the *apparent* coordinates on the scintillator
- Disadvantages of the WF in pixel space:
	- Need detailed information on camera properties to generate synthetic signals in FILDs
	- Produces larger WF (as pixel size is usually much smaller than the grid size we use in Energy/pitch at the scintillator)
- Route and actions:
	- We have now several new methods and algorithms, hence, opening a new branch with new WF would include unnecessary complexity. First we should consolidate the new techniques we have from Bo and Marina and later, we can think of opening new coordinates. 
	- For the future: a new method will be added to the code in order to calculate the WF in pixel space, (the old ones would be keep, we will have both in parallel)
