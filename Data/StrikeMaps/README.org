* STRIKE MAPS

You should place in this folder your library of strike maps.

For FILD, create a folder call FILD.

Inside the FILD folder create two folders: 'Remap', and 'Tomography'. Inside each of those folders, you must place the strikemap and strikepoints files (strike points only if you want, they are not needed for remap) in a folder named AUG.

To obtain the FILD strike maps for AUG, go to https://datashare.mpcdf.mpg.de/s/yyLR7hCKNBqK34W
You can download the folder you prefer (indications in the README), and place it inside FILD.
When you are done, the path should look like this:
ScintSuite/Data/StrikeMaps/FILD/Remap/AUG
And inside AUG all the .dat files will be found.

Inside each folder there should be a FILDSIM namelist called: parameters.cfg, the suite will load default options (nmarkers etc) from there, in that way all strike maps in the folder will be calculated under the same parameters. This reference configuration file is given by default in the distributed zip.
